                Planck is a rewrite of the previous project <a
                    href="https://github.com/HemanthHaridas/plank.py">plank.py</a>, which was a mixture of CPython and
                Cython. The older version suffered from poor performance due to its design and my limited programming
                skills at the time of its creation. Planck, on the other hand, is written entirely in C++ and
                incorporates OpenMP parallelism to improve performance in critical sections. However, it is important to
                note that Planck is not intended to replace commercially available software like Gaussian, GAMESS, or
                NWChem. Instead, it serves as a set of programs suitable for educational purposes. Planck is distributed
                under the GPL3 License.
            </p>
            <h2 class="installation-instructions" id="installation-instructions"> Installation Instructions </h2>
            <p>
                Planck uses the library Boost in the backend for parsing the basis set files and to keep track of the
                process times. Therefore it is mandatory to install Boost before installing Planck. You can find
                instructions on how to install Boost based on your OS in the official Boost website. Planck also uses
                libmsym library for detection of molecular symmetry and orbital symmetries, and Eigen for matrix operations.
            </p>

                <p>git clone https://github.com/HemanthHaridas/planck.git</p>
                <p>cd planck</p>

                A set of basis sets (sto-3g, 3-21g and 6-31g) are bundled with the code, and would be installed in the
                same directory as the executable. A Python code is provided to convert a gaussian basis set (.gbs) file
                to the corresponding .xml file (which is the file format used in Planck). The generated files can then
                be placed in the /basis folder in the installation directory.

                This would perform a single point calculation on a water molecule using sto-3g basis set at a Restricted
                Hartee-Fock level. You have the option to provide the coordinates in units of angstroem or in units of
                Bohr. You can also set the detection of molecular symmetry to be on or off by setting the value to be 1
                (on) or 0 (off).

            <p>
                Planck currently supports energy calculations on molecules of any size using basis sets of arbitrary
                angular momenetum.
